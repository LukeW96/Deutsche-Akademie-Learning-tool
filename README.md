# Deutsche-Akademie-Learning-tool
An imaginary school system teaching English to German vocabulary. 

The project makes use of Java Server Faces, and data is stored in a MySQL database (Users will need to add their own SQL database to use this project)

The project allows students to create accounts, take tests, and access their test history.
Tutors can view the grades of all students, and ammend the vocabulary list where necessary.
administrators can ammend privilege levels of users.
